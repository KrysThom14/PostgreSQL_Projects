# SQL-Scripts
I did 3 small projects using data I collected from Kaggle. First, I used SQL (postgresql) to look through, filter, and do some quick analysis of the data. I then used Tableau to visualize the data from these tables which can be found here: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/krystopher.thompson
