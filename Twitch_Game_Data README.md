# Twitch_Game_Data

This data set contains information that was scraped from https://www.twitch.tv/
The information includes the top 200 games streamed on the platform each month from 2016 - 2021. The data set was downloaded from Kaggle and required very little cleaning of the data. I attached both the original and cleaned csv files so you can see the difference (very little).

Apologies for the blurry images. If anyone knows how to fix it, please let me know. Thanks.
